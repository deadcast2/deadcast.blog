    <h3>Refactorings</h3>
    <em>posted on 10/29/21</em>
    <p>
      Refactoring is a great skill that I continually practice when writing any software. Once I've finished a new feature or bug fix I then take a little bit of time to see if any improvements could be made to what was written. I look for any method or variable name that could be more precise or for a piece of code that should be extracted or positioned elsewhere. Maybe even a function declaration could be re-worked or the introduction of a new class. Quickly seeing spots for refinement takes a bit of practice, not surprisingly, but one can progress their learning much faster with great published materials like the book <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html" target="_new">Refactoring</a> by Martin Fowler and Kent Back. There are many fun, interesting refactorings I have completed and I wish to start sharing them. This list will grow over time as I discover new worthy candidates.

      <li><p><b>C#</b> - Instead of writing a comment to explain that I'm going to remove all of the HTML content from a string to just gather the text to pass in the POST request I decided to create a new method with a clearly defined function name that performs this operation. Doing so eliminated the need for a comment with the potential to go stale and made a new reusable method.</p>
